                    Hi, I&apos;m AL HABIB — a passionate Software Developer with
                    a strong focus on frontend development. My journey began
                    with curiosity, transformed into passion, and continues as a
                    career fueled by creativity and impact.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                    I specialize in building modern, scalable web applications
                    using React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. I
                    also enjoy working with backend technologies like Node.js
                    and Express. I value clean, maintainable code and meaningful
                    user experiences.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-500">
                    Outside of code, I’m into tech blogging, sketching, and
                    solving brain teasers. Currently, I’m seeking opportunities
                    to grow, contribute, and collaborate on impactful tech
                    projects.
